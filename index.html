        <h2>About Me</h2><br>
        <p>Learning to code was not an easy task, but I started with a simple yet powerful language in the 90s, QBasic. From making a simple "login" page to my "secret prgram" with my cousin to later in highschool creating a multiple level Pac-Man styled game with pound signs and circles, and dabbled in HTML in the early days of myspace and on Neopets</p>
        <p>When i enrolled in school at <b><i>The Evergreen State College</i></b> I started dabbling in several languiages such as Python and Javas in my computer programming courses. Over the years I have explored several other languages such C#, C++ and now I am working on mastering my web development skills with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
